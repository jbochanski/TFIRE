random: when tracing initally, check interactive. a marks peaks.

--> fire_get_fitnum
lines 17 and 26, commented out line with underscore to deal with TUI naming conventions

--> fire_oscan
line 26 and 27 changed to set gain to 3.5 from Tspec users manual
lines 29-40 changes to set read noise to 18/sqrt(nfowler). Commented out all the original code and added 2 lines
lines 50 and 51 changed to accept the read nrow and ncol
note: I still have qualms because there is no "overscan" region in the data - i want to see the fire data to check if there is in that data.

--> fire_traceorders
line 109 changed norders to 5
line 137 and 138 commented out pre-stored edgest (i will enter my own if needed)
line 435 changed order mask to 76543
line 462 changed generation of ordr_str structure to reflect order numebrs 
line 169 and 170 changed the sort to a reverse sort so that the order of the peaks would be ok
line 171 and 217 - 219 changed 21 to 5 for maximum number of peaks and 20 to 4 for sort

--> fire_find_edges
line 166 added cutoff = abs(cutoff) because of a problem where the cutoff was negative. This may be due to a oversubtraction issue...
line 118 added nx = 900 to stop it from finding peaks after that (the Tspec data stops @ ~820).

--> fire_findslits
line 78 commented out fsr

--> firehose
line 300, 305 564, 569, 572, 573, 580, 583, 585 changed _ to _. for more flexible naming

--> fire_scattlight
lines 36-39 commented out so that we don't cut out orders

--> fire_ordermask
line 53 changed 32 to 8 to reflect order numbering
lines 91 and 92 commented out to leave whole orders intact (line 86 is coincidentally very good - order 31 = order 7)
line 95 changed to remove *ord30mask*ord29mask

--> fire_mkstruct
line 1055 deleted fire*.fits > *.fits
1072 - end = mass carnage. Also, the object id only works if you name your objects by their name. other fields should be more general apo tspec.


--> fire_nums_to_filenames
modified most of this short program to list real files from the raw directory instead of making up their own names.

Don't try:
more than one flat in the trace flat box (more errors to be debugged - also only need one)

;---------------------------- above was needed to get through structure step below...

--> f_fitpixarc
line 231 added a manual fix to ordr_str.order, don't know where to fix original
line 312 changed for reflect different orders
line 331 changed to exclude parts of order 7 instead of the nonexistant 31
line 350 THIS IS WHERE TO GET ARC
line 609 commented out because that is always the error message
line 1137 replaced to check if structure exists before clearing pointer

--> fire_arc2
line 137 changed for naming conventions
line 84 changed to set the slit to 1.1
line 88 not changed but i think it should be....
line 152 changed to take out maskbadpix - no current tspec mask
line 191 changed with my own guess
line 229 changed with the correct dimensions

--> fire_wavepix
line 7 commented out fsr
line 66 commented out due to lack of bad pixel mask
lines 160-162 commented out to keep good data
line 157 changed to reflect correct order
line 370 changed to 0 to allow some good tilts
line 804 to 808 commented out to keep good data
line 799 changed the 600ish to 1000 to keep right amount of curved order

;------ now we've got a wavelength solution, i think....
--> fire_findobj
line 122 reset to have 5 orders instead of 21
lkine 139 commented out for fsr


--> fire_pipe 
lines 317-322 commented out, line 328 replaces commented above to make science image act as lamp
line 431 changed comment to be gender neutral
line 560 commented out, i dont care about the lamp keyword
line 566 changed to use OH lines (because it's the science image used as arc)

--> fire_proc
lines 125-130 commented out to prevent bad pixel mask

line 227 changed 11L to 3L

-----::::::::-----
Very important to keep cdelt the same. (in fire_echextobj and the other writing out programs) the value I've chosen is 30.5.
